# Bankly
This project is a Bank Management System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows multiple users to create and manage their own bank accounts. The key features include account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and checking account information.

# Features

 * Account Creation: Users can create new accounts, including savings and current accounts, with basic details like the account holder's name.
 * Deposit: Users can deposit money into their accounts.
  
 * Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their accounts. For savings accounts, withdrawals are restricted if the balance falls below ₹500. For current accounts, withdrawals are restricted if the balance falls    below ₹1000.
  
 * Account Information: Users can view account details, such as the account holder's name and current balance.
  
# Additional Functionality

 * Savings Account Restrictions: If a user with a savings account attempts to withdraw money that results in a balance below ₹500, further withdrawals are not allowed.
  
 * Current Account Restrictions: If a user with a current account attempts to withdraw money that results in a balance below ₹1000, further withdrawals are not allowed.
  
 * Multiple User Support: The system supports multiple users, each with their own accounts.
